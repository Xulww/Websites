This is my MVC ASP.NET project. MVC is software design pattern which divides the related program logic into three interconnected
elements - Model, View and Controller. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information
is presented to and accepted from the user.

It's a university system that contains information about the students, faculties, lectors and partners of an imaginary university.
You can create, read, update and delete the information.

Between the tables in the database there are 1 to many and many to many relationships.

MADE WITH ASP.NET, RAZOR, SQL, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP AND JQUERY.
