This is my MVC ASP.NET project.
It's a university system that contains information about the students, faculties, lectors and partners of an imaginary university.
You can create, read, update and delete the information.

Between the tables in the database there are 1 to many and many to many relationships.

MADE WITH ASP.NET, RAZOR, SQL, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP AND JQUERY.
