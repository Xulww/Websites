This is a website that I developed on my own without the help of anyone else. I know it's nothing special and it can be optimized even more
but I'm happy with it and I'm satisfied that I managed to finish it and make it work.

Single-page application where you can buy products from popular shops and supermarkets and get them delivered to your home.
This is a fully functional react app with authentication and a connected database.
Yes, i do receive the orders.

You can check it out here: https://groshaway-groceries.firebaseapp.com
(Hosted on firebase)

It's using only hooks and I know it's not the best idea but I wanted to build a website that uses only react hooks.
It has a bug that occured during deployment for some reason when you hover on a supermarket card it disappears but you can still click it
and the app works fine. It's a problem with the css i will fix it in the future. Strangely it's ok when i start it through the console. lol

MADE WITH REACT, REACT HOOKS, FIREBASE (THE DATABASE), AXIOS, JAVASCRIPT, HTML, CSS and more!
